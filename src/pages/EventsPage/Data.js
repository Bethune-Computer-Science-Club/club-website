  textDescription: "The Canadian Computing Competition is a programming competition held in February by the University of Waterloo. Participants will have three hours to solve 5 problems.\nIn the Junior division, problems mostly test your basic knowledge of programming. \n In the Senior division, problems will involve more complex algorithms involving topics such as graph theory, dynamic programming, and string algorithms.\nThe CCC is the flagship contest for computer science students at Bethune. As such, we spend several meetings helping our members prepare for it."
